# Honeybadger for Java
 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-java.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-java)

This is the notifier JVM library for integrating applications with the :zap: [Honeybadger.io error notification
service](https://www.honeybadger.io/).
When an uncaught exception occurs, Honeybadger will POST the relevant data to the Honeybadger server specified in your environment.

## Supported JVM versions

| JVM               | Supported Version |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Oracle (Java SE)  | 1.7, 1.8          |
| OpenJDK JDK/JRE   | 1.7, 1.8          |

## Supported web frameworks

| Framework         | Version |
| ----------------- | ------- |
| Servlet API       | 3.1.0   |
| Play Framework    | 2.4.2   |
| Spring Framework  | 4.2.2   |

The Play Framework Spring are supported natively (install/configure the library and your done). 
For the Servlet API, you  will need to configure a [servlet filter](https://github.com/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-java/blob/master/src/main/java/io/honeybadger/reporter/servlet/HoneybadgerFilter.java) 
and enable it in your application. As for manual invocation of the API, you will need to configure 
your application to directly call the [reporter class](https://github.com/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-java/blob/master/src/main/java/io/honeybadger/reporter/HoneybadgerReporter.java). 
You can find more information about this in the stand-alone usage section.

## Getting Started

Honeybadger works out of the box with many popular Java frameworks. Installation is just a matter of including the 
jar library and setting your API key. In this section, we'll cover the basics. More advanced installations are 
covered later. 

### 1. Install the jar

The first step is to add the honeybadger jar to your dependency manager (Maven, SBT, Gradle, Ivy, etc). 
In the case of Maven, you would add it as so:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.honeybadger</groupId>
    <artifactId>honeybadger-java</artifactId>
    <!-- Set the specific version below in order to ensure API compatibility in future versions -->
    <version>LATEST</version>
</dependency>
```

In the case of SBT:

```
libraryDependencies += "io.honeybadger" % "honeybadger-java" % "]1,)"
```

For other dependency managers an example is provided on the [Maven Central site](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22io.honeybadger%22%20AND%20a%3A%22honeybadger-java%22).

If you are not using a dependency manager, download the jar directly and add it to your classpath.

### 2. Install a slf4j compatible logging library or binding in your project

*Note*: If you are using [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) or the 
[Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/), a slf4j compatible logger is
installed by default.

All dependencies needed for running are included in the distributed JAR with one
exception - slf4j-api. We expect that you are using some logging library and that
you have imported the sl4j-api in order to provide a common interface for the 
logger to imported libraries.

Almost every logging library provides a means for it to be compatible with the slf4j API. 
These are two good candidates if you aren't sure about which one to choose:

 * [Logback](http://logback.qos.ch/)
 * [log4j2](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/log4j-slf4j-impl/index.html)

### 3. Set your API key and configuration parameters

Next, you'll set the API key and some configuration parameters for this project.

#### Stand-alone Usage

If you want to send all unhandled errors to Honeybadger and have them logged to slf4j via 
the error log level, you will need to set the correct system properties (or provide a [ConfigContext](https://github.com/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-java/blob/master/src/main/java/io/honeybadger/reporter/config/ConfigContext.java)) and add a single line to the thread in which you want to register the error handler.

A typical stand-alone implementation may look like:

```java
import io.honeybadger.reporter.HoneybadgerUncaughtExceptionHandler;

public class MyApp {
 public static void main(String argv[]) {
     HoneybadgerUncaughtExceptionHandler.registerAsUncaughtExceptionHandler();
     // The rest of the application goes here
 }
}
```

You would invoke it with the ```-Dhoneybadger.api_key=<my_api_key>``` system parameter and any other configuration values via system parameters it would load with the correct state. It would then register itself as the default error handler.

#### Servlet Usage

A servlet based implementation may look like:

In your web.xml file:

```xml
    <!-- Send all uncaught servlet exceptions and servlet request details to Honeybadger -->
    <filter>
        <filter-name>HoneybadgerFilter</filter-name>
        <filter-class>io.honeybadger.reporter.servlet.HoneybadgerFilter</filter-class>
        <init-param>
            <param-name>honeybadger.api_key</param-name>
            <param-value>API KEY GOES HERE</param-value>
        </init-param>
        <init-param>
            <param-name>honeybadger.excluded_sys_props</param-name>
            <param-value>bonecp.password,bonecp.username</param-value>
        </init-param>
        <init-param>
            <param-name>honeybadger.excluded_exception_classes</param-name>
            <param-value>org.apache.catalina.connector.ClientAbortException</param-value>
        </init-param>
        <!-- By default this is true. Toggle to false if you don't want users to be able
             to send feedback. -->
        <init-param>
            <param-name>honeybadger.display_feedback_form</param-name>
            <param-value>false</param-value>
        </init-param>
    </filter>
    <filter-mapping>
        <filter-name>HoneybadgerFilter</filter-name>
        <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
    </filter-mapping>
```

**Note: If you have other code executing in your servlet-based application that doesn't go through the servlet interface, you will want to register an exception handler for it in order to report errors to Honeybadger. See the *Stand-alone Usage* section.**

#### Play Framework Usage

This library has been tested against Play 2.4.2. After adding Hondeybadger as 
a dependency to your dependency manager as explained in the 
[Install the jar section](#instal-the-jar-section), you can enable 
Honeybadger as an error handler by adding the following lines to your
conf/application.conf file:

```
honeybadger.api_key = <<API KEY>>
# You can add any of the Honeybadger configuration parameters here directly
# honeybadger.excluded_exception_classes = com.myorg.AnnoyingException 
play.http.errorHandler = io.honeybadger.reporter.play.HoneybadgerErrorHandler
```

This will allow the library to wrap the default error handler implementation and
pass around Honeybadger error ids instead of the default Play error ids.

#### Spring Framework Usage

This library has been tested against Spring 4.2.2 using Spring Boot. After adding 
Hondeybadger as a dependency to your dependency manager as explained
in the [Install the jar section](#instal-the-jar-section), you can enable Honeybadger
as an error handler by adding the `honeybadger.api_key` configuration parameter to
your [Spring configuration](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html).
Spring allows for many different vectors of configuration and it is beyond the scope
of this document to describe all of them. For example, if you were using a file-based
application configuration, you would need to add your Honeybadger configuration
parameters as follows:

```
ENV = production
honeybadger.api_key = <<API KEY>>
honeybadger.excluded_exception_classes = com.myorg.AnnoyingException
```

*Note*: Spring doesn't support the concept of a single environment name. Rather,
it supports [a pattern of using multiple profiles](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-profiles.html) 
to determine the runtime configuration. This pattern doesn't map nicely to
Honeybadger's configuration, so you will need to define `ENV` or `JAVA_ENV`
within your configuration in order for it to map properly to Honeybadger's
way of doing things.

## API Only Usage

If you want to send exceptions to HoneyBadger without having to register an uncaught 
exception handler, you can create an instance of ```HonebadgerReporter``` and call 
the ```reportError(Throwable error)``` method directly. Besides, you can add tags to
your reported exception by calling ```reportError(Throwable error, Object request, Set<String> tags)```.

This is an example of calling how you might configure the Honeybadger
library and use it to send an error to the API programmatically.

```java
package com.myapp;

import io.honeybadger.reporter.HoneybadgerReporter;
import io.honeybadger.reporter.NoticeReporter;
import io.honeybadger.reporter.config.StandardConfigContext;
import com.google.common.collect.ImmutableSet;

public class ApiUsage {
    public static void main(String[] argv) {
        StandardConfigContext config = new StandardConfigContext();
        config.setApiKey("ab3fg93xs")
              .setEnvironment("staging")
              .setApplicationPackage("com.myapp");
        
        NoticeReporter reporter = new HoneybadgerReporter(config);
        Throwable t = new RuntimeException("I'm a custom error");
        reporter.reportError(t);

        // send exception with tags
        reporter.reportError(t, null, ImmutableSet.of("testing", "example"));
    }
}
```

## Advanced Configuration

There are a few ways to configure the Honeybadger library. Each one of the ways is implemented as a [ConfigContext](https://github.com/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-java/blob/master/src/main/java/io/honeybadger/reporter/config/ConfigContext.java) that can be passed in the constructor of the [HoneybadgerReporter](https://github.com/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-java/blob/master/src/main/java/io/honeybadger/reporter/HoneybadgerReporter.java) class. The implementations available are:

 * [DefaultsConfigContext](https://github.com/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-java/blob/master/src/main/java/io/honeybadger/reporter/config/DefaultsConfigContext.java) - This configuration context provides defaults that can be read by other context implementations.
 * [MapConfigContext](https://github.com/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-java/blob/master/src/main/java/io/honeybadger/reporter/config/MapConfigContext.java) - This reads configuration from a Map that is supplied to its constructor. 
 * [PlayConfigContext](https://github.com/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-java/blob/master/src/main/java/io/honeybadger/reporter/config/PlayConfigContext.java) - This reads configuration from the Play Framework's internal configuration mechanism.
 * [ServletFilterConfigContext](https://github.com/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-java/blob/master/src/main/java/io/honeybadger/reporter/config/ServletFilterConfigContext.java) - This reads configuration from a servlet filter configuration.
 * [SpringConfigContext](https://github.com/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-java/blob/master/src/main/java/io/honeybadger/reporter/config/SpringConfigContext.java) - This reads configuration from the Spring framework's internal configuration mechanism.
 * [StandardConfigContext](https://github.com/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-java/blob/master/src/main/java/io/honeybadger/reporter/config/StandardConfigContext.java) - This reads configuration from the system parameters, environment variables and defaults and is **the default configuration provider**.
 * [SystemSettingsConfigContext](https://github.com/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-java/blob/master/src/main/java/io/honeybadger/reporter/config/SystemSettingsConfigContext.java) - This reads configuration purely from system settings.
 
### Configuring with Environment Variables or System Properties (12-factor style)

All configuration options can also be read from environment variables or [Java system properties](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/sysprop.html)
when using the default [StandardConfigContext](https://github.com/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-java/blob/master/src/main/java/io/honeybadger/reporter/config/StandardConfigContext.java).
Framework specific configuration contexts use of environment variables or system properties depends on the framework's implementation.

## Custom Error Pages (ServletFilter)

The Honeybadger library has a few parameters that it looks for whenever it renders an error page. These can be used to display extra information about 
the error, or to ask the user for information about how they triggered the error. Most of the parameters just link to a resource file that can provide
translations for the strings displayed to the user.

| Parameter                             | Description          |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `honeybadger.feedback.error_title`    | Title of page        |
| `honeybadger.feedback.thanks`         | Thank you message    |
| `honeybadger.feedback.heading`        | Prompt for feedback  |
| `honeybadger.feedback.labels.name`    | Explanation query    |
| `honeybadger.feedback.labels.phone`   | Phone number label   |
| `honeybadger.feedback.labels.email`   | Email label          |
| `honeybadger.feedback.labels.comment` | Comments label       |
| `honeybadger.feedback.submit`         | Submit button label  |
| `honeybadger.link`                    | HB link label        |
| `honeybadger.powered_by`              | Powered by HB text   |
| `action`                              | Form POST URI        |
| `error_id`                            | Honeybadger Error ID |
| `error_msg`                           | Error message        |

The default template is setup to collect user feedback and to suppress the display of the error message.
This behavior can be changed by placing a new [mustache template](https://mustache.github.io/) in your 
classpath and specifying its path via the `honeybadger.feedback_form_template_path` configuration option.

### Collecting User Feedback (ServletFilter)

When an error is sent to Honeybadger, an HTML form can be generated so users can fill out relevant 
information that led up to that error. Feedback responses are displayed inline in the comments section 
on the fault detail page.

This behavior is enabled by default. To disable it set the configuration option 
`honeybadger.display_feedback_form` to `false`.

## Contributing

If you're adding a new feature, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/honeybadger-io/honeybadger-java/issues/new) 
as a preliminary step; that way you can be (moderately) sure that your pull request will be accepted.

### To contribute your code:

1. Fork it.
2. Create a topic branch `git checkout -b my_branch`
3. Configure integration tests to use your API keys (see below).
4. Run unit and integration tests `./gradlew check`
5. Commit your changes `git commit -am "Boom"`
6. Push to your branch `git push origin my_branch`
7. Send a [pull request](https://github.com/honeybadger-java/honeybadger-java/pulls)

### Testing
For the purpose of one off testing, you can use the CLI utility. Just execute it using
```./gradlew run``` and you can enter in your API key and message to be sent to
Honeybadger.

#### Running the tests

This library by requires access to the remote Honeybadger API, so in order to
run automated tests you will need to specify system properties to Java in order
configure the remote API key and other settings.

If you are running the tests from gradle, it is easy to specify system properties
using a gradle.properties file placed in the root of the project or in your 
$HOME/.gradle directory.

A sample gradle.properties file may look like:

```
systemProp.ENV = TEST
systemProp.honeybadger.api_key = 1efa3d71
```

With this in place you can run the tests from gradle by using the wrapped
version of gradle that is bundled with the project by:

```
./gradlew check
```

If you are executing your tests from an IDE like IntelliJ, you may need to
manually set the system variables as part of the test run configuration.

For developers pushing to Maven repositories, you will need to specify
the location of your signing keys in gradle.properties. You also shouldn't
put the file in the project root, but rather store it in your .gradle directory
within your home directory. Properties for signing look like:

```
signing.keyId=345A20CE
signing.password=J6N0phB*f3aRH4bZ
signing.secretKeyRingFile=/home/user/.gnupg/secring.gpg

ossrhUsername=user
ossrhPassword=AFbz3BjdE4Q9g2E&
```

#### Platform differences

We collect performance metrics on the machine in which an error occurs. This means that we have
to do platform specific operations. Currently, these operations are best supported on Linux systems
and have minimal support on other platforms.
